<h2>About</h2>

<div class="aboutContainer">
    <p>This web application demonstrates ASP.NET MVC architecture. The 3 main logical components are as follows.</p>       

    <h4>Model:</h4>
    <p>
        It represents the data.The Model component corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with. Model represents the shape of the data.
        A class in C# is used to describe a model (Movie.cs). Model objects store data retrieved from the database.
        In this example the MoviesDBModel will retrieve the movies from the database (App_Data/MoviesDB.mdf).
    </p>

    <h4>View:</h4>
    <p>
        It is the User Interface.The View component is used for all the UI logic of the application. View display model data to the user and also enables them to modify them.
        In this example Index.cshtml include all the UI component required for the user to interact and perform CRUD operations.
    </p>

    <h4>Controller:</h4>
    <P>
        It is the request handler. The controller handles the user request. Typically, the user uses the view and raises an HTTP request, which will be handled by the controller.
        The controller processes the request and returns the appropriate view as a response. In this example HomeController handles all the request generated by the user from the view.
        This controller updates the model based on the request and returns the response back to the view.
    </P>
